This app is madeup of two parts. The budgeting part web application for students can help them manage
their finances more effectively by providing a platform to track their income, expenses, set budgets,
and monitor their spending habits. The scope of such an application includes features such as categorizing
expenses into different categories such as food, rent, transportation, and entertainment. It can also
provide suggestions on saving money and setting financial goals such as saving for textbooks or
reducing debt. The application may also include features such as alerts for upcoming bill
payments, automatic data entry, and customized reports to help students visualize their spending
patterns. With a budgeting web application, students can learn to manage their money
responsibly, avoid unnecessary spending, and build a solid financial foundation for their future.
The to-do list part of our web application designed for students would aim to provide a simple
and effective tool to help students organize and manage their tasks and assignments. The
application would provide a user-friendly interface for students to input their assignmentâ€™s due
dates and exam dates to track their progress in completing these tasks. The scope of the
application would include features such as prioritization of tasks, categorization by subject or
class, notifications and reminders, and the ability to add notes or comments to tasks.
Additionally, the application could provide analytics and insights to help students better
understand their productivity and time management habits. The ultimate goal of the to-do list
web application would be to help students stay on top of their workload and reduce stress by
providing a clear and organized view of their tasks and deadlines.
